  You're a <i>Don Juan</i>.
</p>

<p>
  With all these attractive ideas, you simply cannot commit to just one.
  You will explore them all, one at a time.
  Just long enough for you to lose interest and then will you move on.
  But what happens with the ones you leave behind?
  Do you cling on to them?
  Like their still yours?
  Or do you let go?
  Pass them along.
  <a href="/ideas">Keep them alive.</a>
</p>

<p>
  Some day you might find your way back to one.
  Until then you will be busy building your legacy.
  <a href="/projects">Your pyramid.</a>
</p>

<p>
  Never forget though: There is no end-goal to this process.
  The process itself is the reward.
  Creativity is meaningless, but playful.
  Ideas are fun.
  Playing around, exploring, connecting, testing, discovering.
  What better way to learn and to grow?
